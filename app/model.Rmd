# I am creating a OLS model with the candidate data set. The candidate data set
# has more data points since it includes value for each individual candidate
# and their gender.

# Whereas, the aggregate data set only includes the proportion of women in a
# district, which means it only has 68 data points which can make the reading
# less reliable.

# creating a function to test different models for the candidate data set and
# its individual candidates gender

# model for individual candidates' gender instead of aggregates
